###  Data Cleaning & Preparation
---
I began the data analysis process by completing these tasks;

1.  Data loading and inspection.
2.  Handling missing values.
3.  Data cleaning and formatting



###  Exploratory Data Analysis
---
EDA involved exploring the  data to answer key questions, such as :

-  How many calls were recived on average per day ?
-  What is the prevailing sentiments amongst the callers ?
-  What medium was used the most to contact the call centre ?
-  Which call centre branch received the most calls ?
-  What percentage of calls' response time was 'within, Below or Above SLA' ?
-  How many calls were received in the month ?

###  Data Analysis
---
```Excel functions
 Autofit columns to ensure uniformity
  Headers were edited to be distinct
  Data ‚è© Colum & "=day+ (column)" to format dates and extract call day  in the standard fmt
 Ctr + H , to remove duplicate data
```


###  Results and Finding
---
In summary, the analysis revealed the following :

 1.  Each day an average of **1,062** calls were received
 
 2.  The prevailing sentiments amongst the callers was **NEGATIVE**

3.  Direct Calls to the call centres was preffered by a majorrity of the customer at around *32%*, compared to chatbot, email and web that stood at around **23%,23% and 20%** respectively

 4.  Los Angele/CA's call centre received the most call out of all the branhces

5.  More than 80% of the calls were answered **within the SLA**

6.  A total of **32,941** calls were received in the month of October

###  Recommendations
---------------------
The following is recommended for the call centre administrators; 

-  Address common issues causing negative sentiment by enhancing customer service training and improving problem resolution protocols.

-  Improve efficiency in chatbots, email, and web channels to reduce call volume and enhance customer experience.

-  Allocate more resources, such as staff or advanced call-routing systems, to handle the high call volume in Los Angeles/CA.

-  Investigate and resolve key issues behind negative sentiment to improve overall customer satisfaction.
